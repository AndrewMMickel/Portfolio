                        <p>The first project I'd like to show is called "vacation-site". It's a webpage to promote a vacation site of my choice, which I chose as Camp Meriwether. This was one of the first websites I created.</p>

                        <p>My second project to show is a recreation of the Wikipedia homepage. It does not have any real functionality but was more of a test on how to design a nice looking webpage. Overall I'm pretty happy with the results</p>

                        <p>The last project I want to show is my best work yet, a fanpage about the character Zero from the <span style="color:yellow">Capcom</span> series <em>Megaman</em>. This was made entirely on my own and incorporates <strong>everything that I've learned so far</strong> to make a distinct and 'beautiful' page.</p>
